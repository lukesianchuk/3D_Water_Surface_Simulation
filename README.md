# 3D_Water_Surface_Simulation

This project was completed to fulfill a requirement in the University of Waterloo's CM 750 class - Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations.
Here, we use finite volume methods and the shallow water equations to simulate a perturbed fluid surface with boxed boundary conditions.
